# Lab_Neuron_Position_GUI
A user interface for the selection of neurons in wellplate microscope images. Selected areas are used by separate code to measure fluorescence

Example of GUI in use:

Quick Guide:
1)	Run NeuronPosGUIv2.m – this will open a new window – the User Interface figure.
2)	Click the button ‘Select Well Image Folder’ you will be prompted to select the folder that contains the organized well images (the contents should be numbered folders with TIFF image stacks) then you will be prompted to select a settings.txt file that was generated by Micromanager when the experiment was performed.
3)  If the input folder and files are valid you will be presented with the raw 16 bit first frame from the first video of well 001. If you are loading an existing set of Neuron Position .txt files to continue work or make modifications, you may do so by clicking ‘Load From File’.
4)  You will want to get a better look at Well_001. Select ‘PseudoColor with Delta’ in the drop-down menu presently reading ‘Raw Values’. Then click ‘LOAD FRAME’
5)  You are now presented with an 8bit psuedocolor image. White spots represent the largest changes in values in the original data (stimulus end – stimulus start). Some of these white areas are neurons, some of them are noise – the physiology of the animal might be obvious in the psuedocolor image but have no white pixels at all. Additional view types may be added in the future to present you with additional information, as you will need to use your own judgement and intuition to determine what will be measured.
6)  Click ‘Select Neurons’. Your mouse will now be a crosshair + that allows you to click on any point in the image to record the X,Y position as an ‘Animal’ in the position dataset. It is just as important to get animals with no white pixels as it is to get animals with obvious neuron signal. Every position you click on will produce a 16x16 box representing the measurement area, it is annotated with the Animal’s ID# and the Cycle that you are using to select.
7)  Cycles in the timelapse imaging might be hours apart, so it is possible the animals can move so your set of measurement areas might not remain exact. Once you have selected your animals it is recommended to review Cycle/Trial/Frame combinations using the left-side drop-down menus and ‘LOAD FRAME’ button.
8)  If an animal has shifted out of the measurement frame in a subsequent cycle you can add an ‘updated’ position by using the drop-down menu and the ‘Modify Animal’ button on the right-side. If you want to remove an animal entirely you can click ‘Modify Animal’ and then press ‘Delete’ on your keyboard.
9)  When you feel confident all the relevant measurement areas have been marked, click ‘NEXT WELL’ to advance the display to the next well so you can repeat steps 6 through 10.
10)  When a well has no obvious animals or neurons you can skip steps 6 through 9 and click ‘MARK AS NULL’ to record this fact. This will also advance to the next well.
11)  When performing steps 6 through 10 your position marks are only stored in RAM. To save them as Neuron Position .txt files for later use you must click ‘Save To File’. If you are making a fresh position set this will prompt you to specify a folder where the .txt files will be saved. If you have already clicked ‘Save To File’ once and press it again it will use the same folder. If you used ‘Load From File’ (step 4) to get positions from an existing folder, ‘Save To File’ will overwrite the files in that location.
